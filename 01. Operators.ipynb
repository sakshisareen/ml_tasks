    "## What actually is Python?\n",
    "For a computer, Python code is simply characters on a screen. These characters have no idea what to do with themselves unless some other computer program translates them to a language that a machine can understand. It's important to understand that Python is a programming language and that Python the programming language has many different **implementations** that turn those characters to executable machine code. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What does implementation mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "The original implementation of Python is called **CPython** written mainly in C by the ['Benevolent Dictator for Life'][1] Guido van Rossum who started the project in the 80's and released it in 1991. CPython parses the Python code and compiles it to Python bytecode which is then interpreted by the CPython virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an open source language that anyone can contribute to. See the [github repository][2] where [Guido][3] still commits to frequently. Python is considered an **interpreted** language because it is not compiled down to machine code but rather interpreted at run-time (with CPython). Python is also a **dynamically-typed language**, meaning that variables can change types after declaration. Because of these things, it usually executes much slower (10-1000x) than compiled languages like C or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Python?\n",
    "Python is a **high-level** language. High-level as, it is a programming language that is easy to learn, with simple and compact syntax, as well as being quite powerful to complete nearly any task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python does not have to be compiled (technically it is compiled to bytecode but not down to machine code like C), it can be used interactively which makes it excellent for scientific computing where results from operations need to be seen to write further code. Your code can also actually look very similar to what it would look like on paper as a scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python handles many things under the hood like memory management that a lower language like C does not so that you can concentrate on development. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a general purpose programming languages allowing you to develop a wide range of applications from the web to full scale data science pipelines. A small sacrifice in inefficiency allows for great productivity as a developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your first lines of Python in this chapter\n",
    "As previously mentioned, you can only execute Python code in code cells. Code blocks also always have **`In [ ]:`** to the left of them. If there is a number in the brackets, it means that cell was executed and if the code block produced output, you will see an **`Out[10]:`** section below. The number in brackets is the cell's execution order. So, if you see a 10 in the cell, it means that it was the 10th cell to be executed the last time it was ran.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reminder to execute cells\n",
    "All the code cells in this notebook are not executed upon first usage. You can tell they are not executed because they all look like this:\n",

It is important to understand exactly what is meant by the word operator as it will appear frequently within this text.
